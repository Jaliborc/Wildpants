# Wildpants :jeans:
Wildpants is a collection of code functionality shared between Bagnon and Combuctor. Having a shared codebase allow for easier maintenance and for new features to be simultaneously implemented on both addons without additional effort.

Wildpants includes:
* Core useful functionality (frame display management, settings setup, custom item events,...)
* Classes to generate shared UI compoments (item buttons, money display, sort button,...)
* Common features (tooltip counts, item rulesets, flash find,...)

## For Developers
